# ZiemlichWarmHier Docker Setup

This Docker setup automates the process of fetching, processing, and storing climate data.

## Overview

This Docker setup provides a streamlined way to:
1. Fetch 10-minute climate station data from DWD (German Weather Service)
2. Process and extract relevant climate information
3. Upload the processed data to a Scaleway S3 bucket

## Building the Docker Image

Navigate to the root of the project and run:

```bash
docker build -t ist-es-gerade-warm -f jobs/job-update-10min-station-data/Dockerfile .
```

## Running with Docker

### Complete Workflow (Fetch, Process, and Upload)

```bash
docker run \
  -e ACCESS_KEY=your_access_key \
  -e SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key \
  -e BUCKET_NAME=your_bucket_name \
  -e REGION=your_region \
  -e ENDPOINT_URL=your_bucket_endpoint_url \
  ist-es-gerade-warm
```

The container runs a single entrypoint script that:
1. Fetches raw station data using `fetch_station_data.py`
2. Processes it with `extract_10min_station_data.py`
3. Uploads the result to S3 using `upload_to_s3.py`

All steps are executed sequentially in a single run, with appropriate error handling at each stage.
